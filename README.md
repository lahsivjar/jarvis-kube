# jarvis-kube

Jarvis Kube is a framework built on top of kubernetes cluster using arm machines as nodes that provides developers to write modules in any language that can perform tasks, automate day to day processes, play your preferred music, connect to third party apps... the sky is the limit as to what you can do.

## How it works

* Jarvis Kube uses [kube-arm](https://github.com/lahsivjar/kube-arm) for managing the cluster.
* All modules are containerized applications and since it is based on kubernetes cluster all modules can be easily deployed, scaled and managed.
* Having containerized architecture allows Jarvis Kube to support a multitude of languages.
